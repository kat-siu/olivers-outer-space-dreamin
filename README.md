# Oliver's Outer Space Dream

<a href="www.katsiu.com/olivers-outer-space-dreamin/" target="_blank"><b>Live</b></a>

Oliver is doing what he does best - cat napping! He's dreaming of being in outer space, eating all the sushi and drumsticks he wants.  Press <b>space</b> to jump, hold <b>space</b> to float upwards, collect as many food items as you can, and avoid the asteroids! If you lose, Oliver will wake up from his nap, and he's not gonna be too happy with you...
