# Oliver's Outer Space Dream


### Functionality & MVP
Oliver is doing what he does best - cat napping! He's dreaming of being in outer space, eating all the sushi and chicken wings he wants.  Press <b>space</b> to jump, collect as many food items as you can, and avoid the obstacles! If you lose, Oliver will wake up
from his nap, and he's not gonna be too happy with you...

Users will be able to:
- Toggle audio on/off
- Pause/Restart the game

<b>Collision Detection</b>
- Landing on an obstacle will cause the game to be over.
